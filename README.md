# Project Title: Droplet Generation in a Microfluidic T-Junction

## Description
Conducted by Group 2 - Gopal Gupta, Vikram, Chetan, Aryan, Sanidhya, this project explores droplet formation in a 3D T-junction microchannel, analyzing water-oil interactions. Covering fluid dynamics aspects such as mesh creation, boundary conditions, and utilizing the interFoam solver.

## Key Points

### Problem Statement
- Investigated droplet formation in a T-junction microchannel with water and oil.
- Detailed analysis based on properties: density, viscosity, interfacial tension, and inlet velocity.

### Mesh Creation
- Divided into four sections with specific dimensions and color codes.
- Block-mesh with grid size (∆x = ∆y = ∆z) = 10 µm.

### Boundary Conditions
- Defined inlets, outlets, walls, and velocity for accurate simulation.
- Implemented interFoam solver for incompressible, isothermal, and immiscible fluid dynamics.
